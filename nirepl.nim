# I am not fond of REPLs, since I think they are silly dumb approximations
# of the real thing - a fully live environment like Smalltalk.
#
# But ok, its nice as a starter and for going through a tutorial :)
# And this one is minimalistic intentionally, and... we should add enough
# to Ni itself so that it can be written fully in Ni.
